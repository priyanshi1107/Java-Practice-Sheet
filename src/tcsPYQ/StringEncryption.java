/* Bingu was testing all the strings he had at his place
 and found that most of them were prone to a vicious
 attack by Banju, his arch-enemy. Bingu decided to
 encrypt all the strings he had, by the following method.
 Every substring of identical letters is replaced by a
 single instance of that letter followed by the number of
 occurrences of that letter. Then, the string thus obtained
 is further encrypted by reversing it.
 Input:
 s = "aabcâ€œ
 Output: 1c1b2a
 Explanation: aabc
 Step1: a2b1c1
 Step2: 1c1b2a
