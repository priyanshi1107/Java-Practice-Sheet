/*
* . The Card Game Challenge
 You are participating in a unique card game where
 several cards are arranged in a row. Each card has a
 certain number of points written on it. Your goal is to
 collect exactly K cards in such a way that your total
 score is maximized.
 However, thereâ€™s a catch! You can only pick cards from
 either the beginning or the end of the row in each step.
 Once a card is picked, it is removed, and you continue
 picking until you have exactly K cards.
 Input Format:
 Your task is to determine the maximum score you can
 achieve by strategically picking cards.
 The first line contains an integer N, the number of
 cards.
 The second line contains N space-separated integers
 representing the points on each card.
 The third line contains an integer K, the number of
 cards you must pick.
 Output Format:
 Print the maximum score that can be achieved by
 picking exactly K cards optimally.
Input :
 7
1 2 3 4 5 6 1

Output : 12
